No f&#8217;ing popups and no applications that look completely different from one another with nonstandard behaviorsâ€“there should be a standard way to copy and paste something from one window to another and it should work reliably.</p>

<p>One problem is that the iPhone doesn&#8217;t support the concept of selected text. That means you can&#8217;t just select a specific portion to quote of the message you&#8217;re replying to; nor can you select a chunk of the quoted message and delete it while editing. The only way to delete text is one character at a time (although the keyboard does let you press-and-hold to repeat).</p>
<p>&#8230; With no menu bar, there&#8217;s no Edit menu. With no keyboard, there&#8217;s no command-key shortcuts. The Newton solved this with magic gestures. The iPhone solves this by not having a clipboard at all. No copy, no paste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You gotta admit, that&#8217;s at least a little bit funny.</p>]]></content>

<p>A friend of mine is getting an iPhone for her birthday, and she has asked me to buy something like the <a href="http://www.klipsch.com/products/details/igroove-hg.aspx">Klipsch iGroove</a>, but for her iPhone.  i.e. It acts as a charging station for the phone, and lets you play whatever music is on the phone through real speakers.  Does such a thing exist?  Or are the existing class of iPod speaker systems compatible with the iPhone?</p>

<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject, what brand of speakers should I buy?  I am told by audiophile friends that Bose is not worth the money, but they have no other suggestions that don&#8217;t cost, you know, a thousand dollars.  So let&#8217;s rephrase the question: what brand of iPhone-compatible speakers should I buy for under $200?</p>]]></content>
